  <h1>About This 3D Phone Application</h1>

<!-- Main Content -->

  <section>
    <h2>3D Model Construction and Development</h2>
    <p>
      The phone model in this application was built using simple geometric shapes in Blender 
      for simple yet efficient performance. The main body of the phone was created 
      using a scaled cube material, matching the phone's overall structure and shape. Small cubes and 
      cylinders were combined to represent the buttons, carefully positioned along 
      the edges to replicate real phone button placement.
      <br><br>
      Image textures were applied to the front and back faces of the phone with emission materials to display 
      screen content and rear design, adding detail while keeping the model lightweight.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Animation and Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      All animations in this application are triggered through a single control button, 
      allowing users to play the full sequence with one click. The animations were 
      designed to run sequentially, ensuring each movement is demonstrated clearly without 
      overlapping. This provides a smooth and organized user experience.
      <br><br>
      Users can also rotate, zoom, and explore the 3D model interactively using mouse or touch controls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Design Choices</h2>
    <p>
      A clean design approach was followed to keep the focus on the 3D model with a sharp interface. 
      The interface was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with the THREE.js library 
      powering the 3D rendering. The layout is responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices,
      including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
      <br><br>
      Animations and interactions were optimized, allowing users to engage with the model easily.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Shaders, Textures & Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      Basic material shaders were used with lighting effects to create a realistic appearance 
      without heavy computational demands. Image textures were optimized on the phone's surfaces using emissions to
      ensure fast loading times while maintaining visual quality.
      <br><br>
      Geometry was kept simple, using cubes and cylinders to minimize vertex count and enhance 
      performance, even on devices with lower specifications.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The application includes keyboard-accessible controls with descriptive labels, making it 
      usable for individuals who cannot rely on mouse input. High contrast colors are applied 
      for improved readability.
      <br><br>
      Alternative text and descriptions are provided for key elements, enhancing compatibility 
      with screen readers and supporting users with visual impairments.

        <h3>Deeper Understanding Statement</h3>
        <p>Throughout the development of this 3D app, I aimed to push the boundaries beyond the tutorial content and explore advanced 3D interactivity and dynamic content delivery. I extended the basic 3D object viewer by integrating user-triggered animations using JavaScript and custom <strong>three.js</strong> scenes. This allowed me to give users a more immersive experience, where actions like clicking on buttons would trigger animations that change the lighting, camera angle, and even play embedded video content.</p>
      
        <p>While initially focusing on static 3D models, I recognized the importance of optimizing them for performance. I encountered issues with large model file sizes, so I utilized <strong>GLTF</strong> format for better compression and faster load times. Additionally, I added a <strong>responsive design</strong> using <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to ensure the web app functions correcly across different.</p>
      
        <p>Throughout testing, a significant challenge I faced was embedding animations onto the webpage. As each model had multiple animations, only one animation was playing once clicking the buttons.
           To address this, I combined all animation to play<strong>sequentially</strong> and adjusted key frames accordingly to ensure that animations do not overlap.</p>
      
        <p>I also integrated <strong>Three.js features</strong> including changing to wireframe view, toggling spotlight, and adjusting view angle to enhance user experience and improve interaction</p>
    
        <p>In conclusion, the web application not only enhances the user's ability to interact with 3D models but also provides a polished, user-friendly experience with backend support for dynamic content. This project has expanded my technical knowledge, particularly in web development, JavaScript interactivity, and backend integration.</p>
